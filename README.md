# BATTERY

The ChucK code from my solo drum set &amp; electronics project, [BATTERY](https://fullbattery.bandcamp.com/).

# How To
1. Get some drum triggers, or anything that can result in MIDI being sent into your computer.
2. Ensure that you're able to send MIDI notes 0,1,2, and 54-62 (for me, these are kick, snare, floor tom, and SPD pads, respectively).
3. Install [ChucK](https://chuck.stanford.edu/release/) on your computer.
4. Open one of the `.ck` files in this repository in the MiniAudicle IDE (integrated development environment), which is included in the ChucK download process.
5. Hit "Start Virtual Machine" in MiniAudicle, and then hit the green plus sign in the same window you opened your code in.
6. Make music!
7. Issue Pull Requests against this repository to make the code cooler and the music sicker.
